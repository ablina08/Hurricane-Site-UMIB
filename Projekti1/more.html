            <p class="ash-text">A hurricane is a large, organized storm system characterized by a center of low pressure, a closed
                circulation of winds, and strong thunderstorms that produce heavy rains and winds. These storms can be
                very powerful, causing significant damage when they make landfall.</p>

            <h2 class="ash-heading">How Do Hurricanes Form?</h2>
            <p class="ash-text">Hurricanes form over warm ocean waters near the equator. The process begins when moist air rises from
                the warm ocean, and as it moves upward, the air cools and condenses, forming clouds. The rotation of the
                Earth causes the system to spin, and when the system reaches sufficient size, it can turn into a
                hurricane.</p>

            <h2 class="ash-heading">Impact of Hurricanes</h2>
            <p class="ash-text">Hurricanes cause both immediate and long-term damage, including flooding (ex.Hurricane Katrina), wind destruction, and loss of life. Coastal communities are especially vulnerable due to storm surges, while inland areas may experience severe flooding. The rebuilding process after a hurricane can take years.</p>
